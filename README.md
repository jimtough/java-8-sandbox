Playing around with various Java 8 features to help prepare for the OCPJP 8 certification exam.

I am reading the following book to prepare:

 
**Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 8 Programmer Exam 1Z0-809**
 
**A Comprehensive OCPJP 8 Certification Guide**
 
**ISBN: 978-1-4842-1835-8**

Much of my code is organized by book chapter, as reflected by the Java package structure.
