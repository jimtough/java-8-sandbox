Playing around with various Java 8 features to help prepare for the OCPJP 8 certification exam.

I am reading the following book to prepare:

 
**Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 8 Programmer Exam 1Z0-809**
 
**A Comprehensive OCPJP 8 Certification Guide**
 
**ISBN: 978-1-4842-1835-8**
 
[www.apress.com](http://www.apress.com)


Much of my code is organized by book chapter, as reflected by the Java package structure.

I already have the OCPJP 7 certification, so I will be taking the Java 8 upgrade test.
My code will be focused on features that are either new to Java 8, or existing features
that I need to brush up on before I take the exam.
